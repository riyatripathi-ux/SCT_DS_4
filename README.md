From this task, I learned how to analyze real-world traffic accident data to find meaningful patterns. It showed me that accidents don't just happen in bad weather â€” even clear and overcast conditions can be risky, especially during busy times of day. I also learned how to turn data into visual insights, like bar charts and heatmaps, which make it easier to understand accident hotspots and contributing factors like weather, road conditions, and time.
